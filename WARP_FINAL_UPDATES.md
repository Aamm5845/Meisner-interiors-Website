# Interior Design Website - Final Updates Summary

## Latest Corrections Implemented

### ✅ Logo Animation Timing
- **White screen duration**: Reduced to 0.5 seconds
- **Logo fade**: Immediate smooth fade-in animation (no sliding/movement)
- **Panel reveal**: Clean top-to-bottom opening transition
- **Total sequence**: ~3.5 seconds from load to project content

### ✅ Navigation Alignment 
- **Top-left logo**: Raised 2px to align horizontally with hamburger menu
- **Hamburger menu**: Thicker lines (32px width, 2.5px height) for better visibility
- **Perfect alignment**: Both elements now sit at the same visual height

### ✅ Project Overlay
- **Fixed dark overlay**: Constant `rgba(0,0,0,0.6)` opacity throughout

### ✅ Bottom Navigation Cleanup
- **Removed**: "— View project" text from bottom-right selector 
- **Streamlined format**: Now shows only numbers (01/02/03) and project names
- **Progress bars**: Thin white lines that fill during active slide (6.5s duration)
- **Clean navigation**: Matches premium design aesthetic

### ✅ Project Timing
- **Auto-advance**: 6.5 seconds between slides
